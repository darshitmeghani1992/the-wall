## Current milestone

The project is at a conservative **60% production-ready MVP milestone**. This is a weighted
source-and-CI readiness estimate, not a count of files/screens and not a release-readiness claim.

- Remote milestone commit: `ac2d339`
- Local equivalent commit: `b536e1d`
- Exact tree: `08907e3aec30db9fa025b6cf38e867cccefd1667`
- Branch: `codex/protected-media-foundation`
- Draft PR: `#19`
- CI run `127` (`34454622762`): **green**
- Independent Backend review: **APPROVE**
- Independent Frontend review: **APPROVE**
- Independent QA: **PASS** for the exact source-and-CI boundary
- State: **draft, unmerged, undeployed**

No hosted database, production data, public release, merge, or deployment changed at this
milestone.

## Completed and verified at the 60% checkpoint

### Foundation, activation, and navigation

- Expo/React Native application foundation, Supabase client, primary navigation, account routing,
  retry-safe onboarding, once-only walkthrough, and safe deferred-route restoration exist.
- Same-user token refresh preserves valid upload/navigation state; logout or a real account switch
  performs the full security reset.

### Core permissions and social relationships

- Database contracts cover Personal/Shared Wall access and contribution, friends, followers,
  approved writers, blocking, reactions, Anonymous/Secret handling, moderation, and account state.
- Discover supports real people search and relationship actions. Other-Wall contribution is driven
  by the server capability result rather than guessed from friendship.

### Wall and Mark client

- Personal and Other Wall surfaces, Status, Wall switching, integrated composer, Mark detail,
  reactions, edit/delete/removal/report actions, and protected media presentation are present.
- Photo, Voice, and Video client flows exist; Voice and Video are no longer “unimplemented.” Their
  physical-device behavior remains unverified.

### Protected media

- Mark media uses the private protected-media architecture, not public attachment URLs.
- Database reservations, quotas, ordered one-to-five-photo model, worker lifecycle, private reader,
  cleanup/outbox controls, and client reserve/upload/validate/create/cancel/retry workflow exist.
- Source/CI security and contract evidence is green. Hosted Storage, worker interoperability, and
  real-device upload/playback remain deliberately disabled or unclaimed until their later gates.

### Registered-user Shared Wall lifecycle

- Users can search public Shared Walls and see real privacy, membership, and action states.
- Creation supports Public/Private Walls and Public Open Join ON/OFF, then opens the created Wall.
- Public open-join membership is actor-bound and idempotent; posting remains owner/member-only.
- Owners can invite registered users, view the management roster, revoke invitations, remove
  members, and invite removed people back.
- Invitees can accept or decline. Members can leave. Removed users cannot bypass the owner by
  immediately rejoining an open Wall.
- Owners cannot create self-membership or simply leave. Ownership transfer is atomic: the accepted
  target becomes owner and the previous owner becomes a member.
- Owners can delete a Shared Wall only through strong confirmation; stale destinations fail safely.
- Shared-Wall Alerts and deferred routes cover invites, accepted invites, Shared Marks, and
  ownership transfer with graceful unavailable fallbacks.
- Public/private, block, active-account, roster-privacy, exact-result, race, and owner-identity
  boundaries are backend-enforced and covered by the green regression suite.

## Verification boundary

**Verified** for exact tree `08907e3aec30db9fa025b6cf38e867cccefd1667`:

- CI run `127` passed TypeScript, lint, and the complete PostgreSQL security regression suite.
- Independent local QA passed 11 client contract tests, Expo configuration validation, and both
  iOS and Android exports.
- Backend and Frontend independent reviewers issued final **APPROVE** verdicts.
- Independent QA issued **PASS** for source and CI evidence.
- The Shared-Wall lifecycle and its security/race cases passed the exact-tree verification path.

**Unverified and not included as completed production behavior:**

- Hosted Supabase migrations, Auth/RLS/Storage behavior, Edge Functions, worker dispatch/processing,
  signed media delivery, deletion jobs, and legacy-media reconciliation.
- Real hosted accounts and multi-user staging journeys.
- Physical iOS/Android layout, camera/microphone permissions, uploads, playback, background/resume,
  and adverse-network behavior.
- VoiceOver, TalkBack, large text, switch control, contrast, and reduced-motion system verification.
- Measured startup/render/upload performance and representative low-memory/poor-network behavior.
- Push notifications, universal HTTPS/App Links, store fallback, and install-to-intent restoration.
- EAS/TestFlight/Play builds, store review material, production operations, and public release.

## Conservative progress model

“Implementation coverage” describes how much of each workstream now exists in reviewed source.
“Credited readiness” deliberately discounts that coverage when hosted, device, operational, or
release evidence is still absent. The credited points—not raw implementation arithmetic—form the
conservative 60% milestone.

| Workstream | Portfolio weight | Implementation coverage | Credited readiness |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Product, UX contract and architecture | 10% | 100% | 10.0% |
| Foundation, auth and onboarding | 10% | 75% | 6.0% |
| Core backend and permission security | 20% | 90% | 15.0% |
| Core Wall and Mark client journeys | 15% | 70% | 9.0% |
| Friends, followers and Shared Walls | 15% | 80% | 10.0% |
| Protected media end to end | 10% | 75% | 5.0% |
| Alerts, settings, safety and deep links | 10% | 50% | 4.0% |
| Device QA, accessibility, performance and release | 10% | 10% | 1.0% |
| **Total production-ready MVP** | **100%** |  | **60.0%** |

The un-discounted coverage percentages would produce 71.5 points under simple multiplication.
Publishing that as overall progress would overstate readiness because major hosted/device/release
boundaries have not been exercised. The evidence discount keeps the claim honest.

## Remaining 40%

- Complete and polish Personal Wall settings, approved-writer management, follower/friend surfaces,
  remaining Status/Wall-switcher states, and any incomplete Wall/Mark empty/loading/offline paths.
- Complete Alerts beyond the Shared-Wall journeys, blocked-user management, user/Wall reporting,
  moderation operations UI, and the full recoverable account-deletion experience.
- Finish universal links, store fallback, sharing/install restoration, and missing/deleted
  destination handling across every supported link type.
- Deploy and validate the complete protected-media stack in non-production hosted infrastructure;
  reconcile legacy media and perform the separately gated cutover only after adversarial evidence.
- Validate migrations, RLS, Auth, Realtime, Alerts, and all three-user acceptance journeys using
  real hosted accounts.
- Run physical iOS/Android, accessibility, performance, lifecycle, offline, hostile-network, and
  security/privacy testing; fix findings and repeat.
- Produce TestFlight and Play internal builds, finish store/privacy/operational material, and prepare
  the Founder READY/NOT READY release report.

## Known risks and blockers

- Reviewed source and green CI do not prove hosted Supabase/Storage/worker interoperability.
- Protected media must remain production-disabled until hosted processing, cleanup, signed reads,
  legacy reconciliation, and device tests pass.
- Shared-Wall usability and accessibility have not been observed on physical devices.
- Push, universal links, store fallback, and release operations remain open.
- Public release remains a Founder Gate. Merge, hosted migration, paid infrastructure, production
  data changes, and deployment are outside this milestone.

## Next Actions

1. Complete Settings, safety/account lifecycle, approved-writer management, and remaining Alerts.
2. Complete universal/deferred links and store fallback across all supported destinations.
3. Stand up a non-production hosted Supabase/worker environment and execute full multi-user tests.
4. Run physical-device, accessibility, performance, lifecycle, and adversarial QA.
5. Prepare internal iOS/Android builds and the plain-language Founder READY/NOT READY report.

## Founder decision required

None for continued local/draft development. Founder approval is required before merge, hosted or
production changes, paid infrastructure, destructive data operations, or public release.
