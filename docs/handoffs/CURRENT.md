## Latest source-and-CI candidate — 2026-09-18

Draft PR `#22` is at an estimated **70% production-ready MVP candidate** after completing reporting,
Alert receipt reliability, actor-bound account recovery, and the admin moderation queue.

| Client/contract tests | 60/60 pass |
| Independent certification | Remains 65% pending a new exact-tree review/QA pass |
| Delivery state | Draft, unmerged, undeployed |

No hosted migration, production-data change, merge, deployment, or public release occurred. The next
high-impact candidate slice is remaining Wall/Mark empty/loading/offline polish and follower/friend
surface completion, followed by independent exact-tree review and QA.

## Certified draft checkpoint — 2026-09-15

The authorized draft integration branch `codex/integrated-mvp-resume` is now at a conservative
**63% production-ready MVP milestone** for source-and-CI evidence. Draft PR `#22` remains unmerged
and undeployed.

No hosted migration, production-data change, merge, deployment, or public release occurred.

## Latest completed slice

- Server-bound expected-user enforcement is present through migration `0027` and its regression
  suite, preventing stale clients from mutating after an account switch.
- Personal Wall privacy, writer policy, and Anonymous Marks settings have an explicit actor-bound
  save flow with unsaved-change protection.
- Approved writers can be searched, added, and removed without changing friendship/follow state;
  approvals persist when the policy changes.
- Blocked users can be listed and unblocked. Migration `0028` adds a narrow outbound-only,
  privacy-minimized read function with exact ACL, actor precedence, and deterministic 20+1 cursor
  pagination. It does not weaken profile RLS.
- CI loaded and replayed both migrations and passed the full PostgreSQL security suite.
- Independent review and QA approved exact tree `ef8f8d75...`; all 30 client/contract tests,
  TypeScript, lint, Expo config, and iOS/Android production exports passed.

## Certified baseline — 2026-09-10

The-Wall is at a conservative **60% production-ready MVP milestone**.

| Evidence | Exact value |

| Remote milestone commit | `ac2d339` |

| Independent review | Backend **APPROVE**; Frontend **APPROVE** |
| Independent QA | **PASS** for source + CI |
| Delivery state | Draft, unmerged, undeployed |

No hosted migration, production-data change, merge, deployment, or public release occurred.

## What the checkpoint contains

- Founder-approved product/UX contract and architecture, including the protected-media design.
- Expo/React Native foundation, Supabase client, primary navigation, authentication groundwork,
  corrected account routing, retry-safe setup, once-only walkthrough, and deferred-route handling.
- Core database authorization for Personal/Shared Walls, friendships, follows, approved writers,
  blocking, reactions, Anonymous/Secret handling, moderation, and account lifecycle.
- Personal/Other Wall and Mark surfaces, Status, integrated composer, protected media display/write
  clients, Mark actions, reactions, and safety operations, with remaining device/polish work.
- Correct Discover people and relationship journey with privacy-safe counts, capability-driven
  contribution, and fail-closed inaccessible states.
- Protected-media source foundation: private canonical storage/read model, reservations, quotas,
  ordered five-photo support, operations/cleanup controls, trusted-worker foundation, and client
  reserve/upload/validate/create/cancel/retry behavior. Public attachment URLs are not the supported
  Mark-media path.
- Registered-user Shared Wall lifecycle: public search; Public/Private creation; Open Join ON/OFF;
  member-only posting; invite/accept/decline; roster privacy; revoke/remove/invite-back; member
  leave; atomic ownership transfer; strong-confirm deletion; and Shared-Wall Alert/deferred routes.
- A removed member cannot immediately bypass the owner through Open Join. Open Join remains
  available to other eligible users, and an owner may deliberately invite the removed user back.
- Owner self-membership is forbidden: the owner is represented only by `walls.owner_id`; transfer
  atomically makes the previous owner an accepted member.

## Verification boundary

**Certified baseline:** CI run `127` is green on exact tree `08907e3a...`; TypeScript, lint, and the complete
PostgreSQL security regression suite pass in CI. Independently, local QA passed 11 client contract
tests, Expo configuration validation, and both iOS and Android exports. Final independent Backend
and Frontend reviews approved the exact candidate. Independent QA passed the source-and-CI
checkpoint.

**Current checkpoint, independently verified:** TypeScript passes; lint passes with zero errors and
nine pre-existing warnings; all 30 client/contract tests pass; Expo public configuration resolves;
and iOS and Android production exports complete. CI run `134` passed the complete PostgreSQL
security suite. Independent review approved and QA passed the exact tree.

**Not verified:** hosted Supabase, real hosted accounts, Storage/Edge/worker interoperability,
physical iOS/Android behavior, accessibility, performance, adverse networks, push notifications,
universal links/store fallback, EAS/TestFlight/Play builds, production operations, and release.

A source surface is not production-ready merely because it exists or passes CI. Protected media
remains gated until hosted processing, signed reads, cleanup, legacy reconciliation, and real-device
tests pass.

## Conservative 63% model

Implementation coverage records reviewed source breadth. Credited readiness applies an evidence
discount for untested hosted/device/release boundaries and is the number used for overall progress.

| Workstream | Weight | Implementation coverage | Credited readiness |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Product, UX contract and architecture | 10% | 100% | 10.0% |
| Foundation, auth and onboarding | 10% | 80% | 6.5% |
| Core backend and permission security | 20% | 92% | 16.0% |
| Core Wall and Mark client journeys | 15% | 70% | 9.0% |
| Friends, followers and Shared Walls | 15% | 85% | 10.5% |
| Protected media end to end | 10% | 75% | 5.0% |
| Alerts, settings, safety and deep links | 10% | 65% | 5.0% |
| Device QA, accessibility, performance and release | 10% | 10% | 1.0% |
| **Total** | **100%** |  | **63.0%** |

The implementation percentages alone would yield 75.65 points. The 63% claim is intentionally lower
because hosted, device, accessibility, performance, and release evidence is still missing.

## Remaining 37% — recommended order

1. Complete remaining Alerts destinations, reporting/moderation UI, recoverable account deletion,
   and follower/friend polish.
2. Finish universal/deferred links, store fallback, install-intent restoration, and graceful stale
   destinations across all supported object types.
3. Complete remaining Wall/Mark empty/loading/offline states and visual/accessibility polish.
4. Deploy the protected-media services to non-production hosted infrastructure, reconcile legacy
   media, and verify Auth/RLS/Storage/worker/cleanup behavior with real accounts.
5. Run full physical-device, accessibility, performance, lifecycle, offline/error, and adversarial
   security/privacy testing; fix and repeat.
6. Prepare TestFlight/Play internal builds, store/privacy/operations material, and the Founder
   READY/NOT READY release report.

## Resume instruction

Keep `codex/integrated-mvp-resume`, draft PR `#22`, and all predecessor branches unmerged and
undeployed. Continue with remaining Alerts destinations, reporting/moderation, recoverable deletion,
and link/device edge cases through the normal Product → Architecture → implementation → Reviewer →
QA flow. Do not apply hosted migrations, merge, or deploy without a new Founder authorization.
